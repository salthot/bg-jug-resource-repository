Scenario:  Simple BMI calculator validation used for not parametrized story example (1)

Given a body mass index calculator
And Weight Classifier is started
When a patient is with mass 83 kg and height 1.77 m
Then patient's body mass index is 26.493024826049805
And for the calculated bmi value 26.493024826049805, the weight classifier shows: Overweight
